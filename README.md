### The usual stuff

#### Telephone number
Most eSIM cards are for data only. Mint mobile https://www.mintmobile.com/plans/ offers plans with talk, text and data. They also offers a test plan, so you can try it out before deciding. 

#### US bank account
It is difficult to get a US-bank account without a SSN. Getting a SSN takes time, which can be annoying, as some services and paying rent often require an US-bank account. Wise offers a checking account with a US routing number, which you need for direct debits. Once you have your SSN you can always get your preferred credit card.

#### Social Security Number
If you are in LA, then you have to be on American soil for 14 days, before you are able to request a meeting with one of the social security managers. A SSN is needed to fill out a W-2 formular (tax related) and in most cases, your company will pay out salary without a W-2. So if you can afford it, come as early as you can. As this is the first time you will get a SSN, you need to show up in person down at the local social security administration office, you cannot apply online. Due to covid-19, it will usually take 2 weeks from the day you are allowed to request a meeting, to you actually have the meeting. The meeting is rather quick, you have to present a SS-5 formular, your passport and your I-94 adminision number. If everything is fine, you will your SSN mailed after 2 weeks. You cannot get the number early, by say calling them after a few days, you have to wait for the letter to arrive. Overall, it all takes around 6 weeks from the day you enter the US to you have your SSN.

#### ITIN
Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) is needed by if you keep your old bank accounts, as banks are required to send tax related information to US. It takes up to 7 weeks for IRS to send the documents, as your old bank might block your account after 3 months so keep this in mind.

#### Finding a place to live
- Lease appartments. A lease has typically a length between 13-16 months, and comes a break-lease clause that means you should feel certain about your situation, before signing the papers. Expect to either have to pay until the leasing company finds another tenant or 2 months lease, if you need to break the lease. Leasing companies will typically require a good credit history. As you are new in USA, you will not have a credit history and they therefore often ask for a 2-months rate in deposit. 
- AirBnB. More expensive than leasing, but also less financial risk if you are not sure about your new situation
- Corporate housing. Furnished appartments that make it easy to get started.
- Hotel. Simple, less risk, but also expensive and simple things like getting your cloth washed can be problematic. 

#### Proving you have legally entered US
You are sometimes required to provide a I-94 (DHS Arrival/Departure Record issued to aliens who are admitted to the U.S., who are adjusting status while in the U.S. or extending their stay, among other things. A CBP officer generally attaches the I-94 to the non-immigrant visitor's passport upon U.S. entry.). However, the CBP officer is handing out I-94s anymore. Instead get the https://www.cbp.gov/about/mobile-apps-directory/cbpone [CBP One app](https://www.cbp.gov/about/mobile-apps-directory/cbpone) that will give you access to the I-94. 
> "If travelers need the information from their Form I-94 admission record to verify immigration status or employment authorization, they are encouraged to get their I-94 Number from the I-94 website or by using the CBP Oneâ„¢ mobile app"

#### Letting USCIS know your address
You have to register your home address within 10 days of any change of address. This is done by filing an AR-11 via https://www.uscis.gov/ar-11

### Other tips

#### Addresses
You often have to provide your address in a standardized form. Some standardize the address for you, but others will reject your address as invalid, if you are not using the right format. Here are some tips:
