Cheat sheet for relocating to USA


## Getting started

### The usual stuff

#### Telephone number
Most eSIM cards are for data only. Mint mobile https://www.mintmobile.com/plans/ offers plans with talk, text and data. They also offers a test plan, so you can try it out before deciding. 

#### US bank account
It is difficult to get a US-bank account without a SSN. Getting a SSN takes time, which can be annoying as some services and paying rent often require an US-bank account. Wise offers a checking account with a US routing number. Once you have your SSN you can always get your preferred credit card.

#### Social Security Number
You have to be on American soil for 14 days, before you are able to request a meeting with one of the social security managers.

#### Finding a place to live
- Lease appartments. A lease has typically a length between 13-16 months, and comes a break-lease clause that means you should feel certain about your situation, before signing the papers. Expect to either have to pay until the leasing company finds another tenant or 2 months lease to get out early. 
- AirBnB. More expensive than leasing, but also less financial risk if you are not sure about your new situation
- Corporate housing. Furnished appartments that make it easy to get started.
- Hotel. Simple, less risk, but also expensive and simple things like getting your cloth washed can be problematic.
